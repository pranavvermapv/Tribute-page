            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span></span>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee<br><br>
            A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.</p>

                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>First Apperance</h4>
                        <p>Iron Man, American comic book superhero, a mainstay of Marvel Comics, who first appeared in 1963 in Tales of Suspense no. 39. His creation is officially credited to four people: writer and editor Stan Lee, who plotted the first story; his brother Larry Lieber, who scripted it; artist Don Heck, who drew it; and Jack Kirby, who designed Iron Man’s original armoured battlesuit. Iron Man has appeared as the star of his own comic book series, as a regular guest in other popular comics (most notably in the The Avengers), in animated films and television series, and in live-action motion pictures.</p>

                        <h4>Death and Legacy</h4>
                        <p>How Iron Man died?
Tony Stark died at the end of 'Avengers: Endgame' but before that, he saved the entire universe from Thanos and his forces by snapping them out of existence and ending their threat once and for all. But the use of all the six Infinity Stones all at once took its toll on his body and he died of his grievous injuries</p>
                        <p>Tony Stark's death in Avengers: Endgame has left the MCU with a major hole to fill. While characters like Doctor Strange and Spider-Man could become the new faces of the shared universe, it will be Riri Williams who will serve as Iron Man's more direct replacement.</p>

Although this creation was primarily thought of by his father Howard Stark, Tony was the one to carry out Badassium's invention.

Adding another notch to the periodic table of elements was not the only positive to come from this invention. Additionally, Badassium even further prompted the idea of clean energy power sourcing and changed the way MCU viewed technological-environment properties.
